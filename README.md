# Description
This project is a toy-example using [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) and GraphQL.  
I created it to teach myself how to implement a GraphQL server with NestJS, PostgreSQL and TypeORM.


# Running
To run the server use
~~~bash
$ yarn start:dev
~~~
And connect to the server with a web-browser at http://localhost:3000/graphql
